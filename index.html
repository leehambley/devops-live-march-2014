* ## ![Capistrano Logo](http://capistranorb.com/images/CapistranoLogo.png)
  Widely used, widely <strike>hated</strike> *distrusted* tool. (at least, it feels that way, most of the time)

# Contributions

* ## LibSSH
  Ability to read-out SSH compiled config, and other (non-merged) changes to make writing a Ruby gem backed by pure-C possible.
* ## Rails
  Fixes for date time parameter parsing outside of Rails.
* ## `lib/pq` (PorstgreSQL driver, Go) &amp; Go Standard Library
  Fixes for error handling when abusing SQL. (new framework and language, lots of low hanging fruits)
* ### Lots of other less interesting stuff

# Respect

I want to be absolutely crystal clear.... I love all FOSS.

And I think that people are generally rather disrespectful about FOSS projects.

**I'm going to be calling out a few projects by name.**

--

(it's fair to say they are victims of their own success, and we've all run into them in the wild, and benefited, even if we didn't enjoy it)

# because they suck...

--

# because they...

* werent't invented here
* we didn't read the docs
* it was written in July 16, 1999 .red[*]
* it's written in .thing[Java], and ... .thing[Java] sucks too
* it's difficult to install
* my distribution doesn't have a recent version in the package manager
* the tool has it's own package manager

# Truth...State...

> Remember (old-timer?) Linux user typing commands into terminal that goes and mutates the state of the Linux machine. They'll go and stop a process, change configuration file and start the process again. They're the one connecting to the machine and making sure the state of the Linux machine is mutated correctly. Let's call this method Imperative Configuration.

## Bashing Victim #2

![jenkis](http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/jenkins_logo.png)

--

* Widely distributed and packaged, runs basically everywhere.
* More than ***600*** plugins.
* Extensible via plugins.

Jenkins is programatically *installable*, programatically *networkable* (master, and slave).

However the *configuration* is not scriptable, the *list of installed plugins* is not scriptable.

--

**Interactions with the Jenkins UI modify the state, and that state change is not recorded <em>anywhere</em>.**

--

I'm picking on Jenkins, but the example serves to illustrate the problem.

---

# Do we need a Jenkins <strike>package</strike> plugin manager?

# Bashing Victim #3

# Graphite

* Widely used
* Difficult to install

--

* At least it doesn't have plugins
* But it doesn't cluster easily...

---

# Counter Example

# Solr

---

# Counter Example

# <strike>Solr</strike> ElasticSearch

* Easy to install (run a `.jar`, configure via file or CLI flags)
* Well, and widely packaged
* Sane defaults
* No up-front configuration
* Queryable for current state pretty-much any time
* Auto-clustering
* Self-balancing (for the most part)
