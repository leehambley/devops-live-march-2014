# Projects

* ## ![Capistrano Logo](http://capistranorb.com/images/CapistranoLogo.png)
  Widely used, widely <strike>hated</strike> *distrusted* tool. (at least, it feels that way, most of the time)

# Contributions

* ## LibSSH
  Ability to read-out SSH compiled config, and other (non-merged) changes to make writing a Ruby gem backed by pure-C possible.
* ## Rails
  Fixes for date time parameter parsing outside of Rails.
* ## `lib/pq` (PorstgreSQL driver, Go) &amp; Go Standard Library
  Fixes for error handling when abusing SQL. (new framework and language, lots of low hanging fruits)
* ### Lots of other less interesting stuff

# Respect

I want to be absolutely crystal clear.... I love all FOSS.

And I think that people are generally rather disrespectful about FOSS projects.

**I'm going to be calling out a few projects by name.**

* werent't invented here
* we didn't read the docs
* it was written in July 16, 1999 .red[*]
* it's written in .thing[Java], and ... .thing[Java] sucks too
* it's difficult to install
* my distribution doesn't have a recent version in the package manager
* the tool has it's own package manager
